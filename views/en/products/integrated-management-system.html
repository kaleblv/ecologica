                    <h4>Compliance</h4>
                    <h5>Safety Compliance</h5>
                    <p>Whether it is common management standards such as OHSAS 18001, or compliance with regulatory requirements such as OSHA, WCB, RIDDOR and others, companies are frequently required to keep extensive and detailed accounts of their environmental, health and safety information.</p>
                    <h5> OSHA, WCB and RIDDOR Compliance</h5>
                    <p>Intelex’s Business Management software system streamlines the collection, tracking and reporting of your workplace health and safety information and accident, incident and injury reporting. All of the data is input into a centralized database and can be merged into the  reporting forms required by different regulatory bodies. If you report to regulatory bodies other than OSHA, WCB and RIDDOR, specialized merge templates are easily created to accomodate your organization’s specific needs.</p>
                    <h5>OHSAS 18001</h5>
                    <p>Many organizations worldwide adhere to the management practices outlined in the OHSAS 18001 standard. Following these standards helps reduce employee risk, improve the effectiveness of Occupational Health and Safety management, and demonstrate diligence in cultivating a strong safety culture.</p>
                    <p>The components of the Intelex Business Management software system speak directly to requirements within the OHSAS 18001. Specifically:</p>
